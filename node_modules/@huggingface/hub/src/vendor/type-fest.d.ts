/**
Matches a JSON object.

This type can be useful to enforce some input to be JSON-compatible or as a super-type to be extended from. Don't use this as a direct return type as the user would have to double-cast it: `jsonObject as unknown as CustomResponse`. Instead, you could extend your CustomResponse type from it to ensure your type only uses JSON-compatible types: `interface CustomResponse extends JsonObject { â€¦ }`.

Create a type that makes the given keys required. The remaining keys are kept as is. The sister of the `SetOptional` type.

Use-case: You want to define a single model where the only thing that changes is whether or not some of the keys are required.

@example
```
import type {SetRequired} from 'type-fest';

type Foo = {
	a?: number;
	b: string;
	c?: boolean;
}

type SomeRequired = SetRequired<Foo, 'b' | 'c'>;
// type SomeRequired = {
// 	a?: number;
// 	b: string; // Was already required and still is.
// 	c: boolean; // Is now required.
// }
```
