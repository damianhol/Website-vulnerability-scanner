# Web Vulnerability Scanner

Web Vulnerability Scanner is an open-source project developed to help developers test their websites for vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, XSS attacks, and other potential risks like exposed API keys.
Features

    Detect SQL vulnerabilities
    Detect XSS vulnerabilities
    Detect other potential risks such as exposed API keys
    Scan DOM for potential threats
    Generate concise and informative reports using Langchain and OpenAI

## Technologies Used

    Puppeteer
    SQLMap
    DOMPurify
    Langchain
    HuggingFace

## Getting Started

To set up the Web Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
        
Install dependencies:

        npm install

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in analyzeResults.js with your HuggingFace API key.

Run a SQLMAP server in terminal:
 
 cd sqlmap-dev
 
 python sqlmapapi.py -s -H 127.0.0.1 -p 8775

Run server.mjs: 

node server.mjs

Open project with liveserver addon

## Usage

Enter the URL of the website you want to scan for vulnerabilities in the input field and click the search icon. The scanner will analyze the website and return a report detailing any potential vulnerabilities.
It will run SQLMAP and Puppeteer, after 15s you will get a result of the test in the console:

First section that is highlihted (difference) shows what code has been sanitized, it contains snippets that are potentially vulnerable for attacks.
Second highlighted section shows results of SQLMAP scan.

Then those results are being sent to the HuggingFace API using LangChain to give a comprehensive explanation on what kind of attacks can be performed on the website. Currently the code uses LLM gpt-neo-1.3B, I suggest using OpenAI API to get the best in-depth explanation (keep in mind that you have to pay to use OpenAI API)

If you don't want to pay for API key you can use the code as it is right now just paste your HuggingFace API key in analyzeResults.js

### If you want to tweak the scan to make it fit your needs: 

To change SQLMAP scan options simply change values in server.mjs in options variable

To change depth of scan that is performed with Puppeteer and DOMPurify simply change conditional changes to scan more subpages
